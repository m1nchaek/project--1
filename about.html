            I decided to create an index of places where people can fully enjoy the vinyl experience. My inspiration for this project comes from the shared passion my parents and I have for collecting vinyl records and exploring local record shops in search of new music. Vinyl collecting, along with visits to LP bars and vinyl-centric cafes, has always been a fulfilling and enjoyable hobby for us.  <br>  </p>
            <p>
             In my experience, many newcomers to vinyl collecting often turn to online platforms like Amazon to purchase records. While online shopping offers convenience, I believe there’s a deeper, more enriching experience to be found by exploring physical record stores and engaging with knowledgeable shop owners who can offer personal recommendations. <br>
            </p>
            <p> 
             To enhance this experience, I’ve developed a personal rule when purchasing vinyl: I buy two albums I’m specifically interested in, and three albums that are random selections—whether based on a striking album cover or recommendations from the shop owner. This approach has helped me discover new music and embrace the joy of unpredictability in record shopping. I wanted to share this experience with others and encourage them to explore record stores and venues that cultivate a sense of community and discovery.<br></p>
             <p> 
                Through this index, I hope to guide others to local spots where they can not only find great vinyl but also enjoy the unique atmosphere that comes with shopping in person.</p>
